    <h1>Madilu System </h1>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Jean de Dieu Makiese <strong>(May 28, 1952 – August 11, 2007)</strong>,  popularily known as Madilu System, was a <strong>Soukous</strong> singer and songwriter born in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo. He was once a member of <strong>T.P.O.K Jazz</strong> which dominated African popular music in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>Madilu was 19 when he started his career in Kinshasa’s thriving music scene in 1969. Over the next fifteen years he sang with Orchestre Symba, Papa Noel’s Orchestre Bambula, Sam Mangwana’s Festival des Maquisards and his own Orchestre Bakuba Mayopi, but his career thus far neither revealed nor promised anything out of the ordinary (in an extraordinary milieu). It was Franco who made a star of Madilu System (as the big man had dubbed him). "Mamou (Tu Vois)," the record that introduced the new T.P.O.K. Jazz singer, was a hit in 1984. Madilu followed that up with his own composition for the band, "Pesa Position." Then came "Mario" and "Reponse de Mario" in ‘85 and perhaps the best of the Franco-Madilu duets, "La Vie des Hommes" in ’86.</p>
